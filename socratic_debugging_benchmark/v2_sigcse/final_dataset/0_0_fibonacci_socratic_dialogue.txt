<problem>
Create a function `fibonacci(n:int)` that takes in a parameter `n`, an integer representing the number of terms in the Fibonacci sequence to generate, and returns:
-  'OOPS', if `n` is less than or equal to 0 
- `1`  if `n` is equal to `1`
- `1` if `n` is equal to `2`
- Otherwise, return the nth term of the Fibonacci sequence. A Fibonacci sequence is a sequence in which every number is the sum of the previous two numbers in the sequence. Example Fibonacci sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55 ....
## Example Cases:
```
fibonacci(-3) => 'OOPS'
fibonacci(0) => 'OOPS'
fibonacci(1) =>1
fibonacci(2) => 1
fibonacci(5) => 5
fibonacci(10) => 55
```

<bug_code>
1. def fibonacci(n):
2.  if n <= 0:
3.    return "OOPS"
4.  elif n == 1:
5.    return 1
6.  elif n == 2:
7.    return 1
8.  else:
9.     a = 0
10.    b = 1
11.    for i in range(0, n):
12.      temp = b
13.      b = a + b
14.      a = temp
15.    return b
</bug_code>
<bug_desc>
On line 11, the for loop iterates `n` times. Consequently, the function returns the (n+1)th term of the Fibonacci sequence instead of the nth term, as the loop generates one additional term beyond the desired nth term.
</bug_desc>
<bug_fixes>
Replace `range(0, n)` with `range(1, n)` on line 11.
Replace `range(0, n)` with `range(0, n - 1)` on line 11.
Replace `range(0, n)` with `range(2, n + 1)` on line 11.

User: Hey, I really need help. This function is not returning the correct number.
Assistant: I'll be happy to help you. What happens when you call `fibonacci(5)`?
	<alt>Happy to help. Can you give me an example of your function returning an incorrect number?
	<alt>Sure. Can you list the first 5 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence?
	<alt>Can you describe what your code does line by line?
User: When I run the function with `n` as 5 the output is 8 instead of 5.
Assistant: I see. What do you think might be the cause of this?
	<alt>Can you describe your for loop on line 11?
	<alt>Can you walk me through the steps your function takes to generate the Fibonacci sequence?
	<alt>Can you identify any issues with the loop that generates the Fibonacci sequence?
	<alt>Which part of your code do you suspect of causing this issue?
User: I think the cause of this is probably the for loop since that's the only place where I compute `b`, the value that I return.
	<alt>I am not sure. Can you help?
	<alt>I guess maybe the problem is that `a` is set to 0 not 1? I am not really sure.
Assistant: Good. Can you explain your for loop on line 11?
	<alt>What specifically about your for loop on line 11 might be causing the issue?
	<alt>Good. Can you describe how many times the for loop iterates on line 11?
	<alt>Good. How many iterations does the for loop go through and what are the values of `a` and `b` in each iteration?
	<alt>Good. What variables used in the for loop on line 11 should we pay attention to identify the issue?
	<alt>Good. Can you take a closer look at the range of your for loop and think about how it might be affecting the result?
User: The for loop loops from 0 until value of `n - 1`. In each iteration of the for loop, the loop computes a new Fibonacci number by adding the last two Fibonacci numbers together. This newly computed Fibonacci number is stored in `b` while the previous Fibonacci number (which was stored in `b` before the computation) is now stored in `a`.
	<alt>It loops `n` times
	<alt>Not really sure how to describe it.
Assistant: Good, let's examine the loop together. How can we monitor the values of `a`, `b`, and `i` during the loop?
	<alt>What are the values of `a` and `b` in each iteration?
	<alt>What variables used in the for loop on line 11 should we pay attention to identify the issue?
	<alt>Let's step through the function using the debugger and track `a`, `b`, and `i` at each iteration. What do you notice?
	<alt>Let's add a print statement to print the values of `a`, `b`, and `i` after each iteration. After executing the code what do you notice?
User: I'm not really sure can you suggest a way?
	<alt>I can use the debugger!
	<alt>I can add print statements.
Assistant: Have you considered inserting a print statement after line 12 to output the 3 variables?
	<alt>Have you considered using the debugger?
User: Aha! Good idea! Perfect let me do that.

1. def fibonacci(n):

3.    return "OOPS"

5.    return 1
6.  elif n == 2:
7.    return 1
8.  else:
9.    a = 0
10.   b = 1
11.   for i in range(0, n):
12.      temp = b
13.      print(f"a: {a}\tb: {b}\t i: {i}")
14.      b = a + b
15.      a = temp
16.    return b

</code>
Assistant: Let's look at the outputs what do you observe?
User: I observe that `b` starts at 1 and `a` at  0 in the first iteration. `a` basically stores the value of `b` in the previous iteration.  Ultimately, at  `i = 0` `b = 0 + 1` then  at `i = 1` it is `b = 1 + 1` then at `i = 2` it is `b = 1 + 2` then at `i = 3` it is `b = 2 + 3` and at last  when `i = 4` it is `b = 3 + 5` returning 8.
	<alt>It seems like the for loop is iterating one extra time. we want it to stop at `i = 3` where `b` is 5.
	<alt>Hm, it seems like it is creating the Fibonacci sequence in the correct order. I don't notice anything off.
Assistant: What do you notice about the value of `b`? Does it ever hold the correct Fibonacci term?
	<alt>Good. Can you identify the point at which the loop should stop to get the correct Fibonacci number?
User: We would want the for loop to stop at `i = 3` and return `b` as 5, but it iterates one more time since `3 <  5` which is the value of `n`.
Assistant: Good observation. Can you think of a way to modify your for loop so that it returns the correct Fibonacci term?
	<alt>Good. What should you do now to return the correct Fibonacci number?
User: I think I should edit the range of the loop to iterate one less time. Let me edit my code.
<code>
1. def fibonacci(n):
2.  if n <= 0:
3.    return "OOPS"
4.  elif n == 1:
5.    return 1
6.  elif n == 2:
7.    return 1
8.  else:
9.     a = 0
10.    b = 1
11.    for i in range(1, n):
12.      temp = b
13.      print(f"a: {a}\tb: {b}\t i: {i}")
14.      b = a + b
15.      a = temp
16.    return b

</code>
Assistant: Good work. Don't forget to remove the print statement!
User: Ah yes! Thank you so much for your help!
