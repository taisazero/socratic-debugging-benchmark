<problem>
Create a method `returnOdd(nums:List[int]) -> List[int]` that accepts a list `nums`. It should filter out all the even integers from the list `nums` and return a new list that contains only the odd integers from the original list.

## Example Cases:
```
returnOdd([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]) => [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
returnOdd([2, 4, 6, 8, 10]) => []
returnOdd([1, 3, 5, 7, 9]) => [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
returnOdd([-76, -92, 9, -1, 7, 10]) => [9, -1, 7]
```
</problem>
<bug_code>
1. def returnOdd(nums):
2.    newNums = []
3.    for i in nums:
4.        if i % 2 != 0:
5.            newNums.append(i)
6.        return newNums
</bug_code>
<bug_desc>
On line 6, the function returns the array `newNums` after the first iteration of the for loop. Consequently, the function returns `newNums` containing up to 1 odd value from `nums` instead of returning `newNums` containing all the odd values in `nums`.
</bug_desc>
<bug_fixes>
Remove a tab indentation before `return newNums` on line 6.

<unit_tests>
assert returnOdd([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]) == [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
assert returnOdd([2, 4, 6, 8, 10]) == []
assert returnOdd([1, 3, 5, 7, 9]) == [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
assert returnOdd([-76, -92, 9, -1, 7, 10]) == [9, -1, 7]

User: Help, I'm stuck.
Assistant: What should your code be doing?
	<alt>Which test cases (if any) are failing?
	<alt>What are you stuck on?
	<alt>Can you explain your code line by line, given that `nums` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`?
User: Right now, it's only returning the first number in the list, not all of them.
	<alt>It's only passing the second test case.
Assistant: Okay, let's look at your loop. Do you see anything that could be causing it to end early?
	<alt>Have you checked the loop and how many times it iterates?
	<alt>Let's add a print statement into your for loop that prints `i` and then execute it. What do you observe?
	<alt>What do you think might cause your function to return a list with one element instead of multiple elements?
	<alt>Let's use the debugger and step through the function while tracking the values of `i` and `newNums`. What do you observe?
	<alt>What do you think is causing the lists not to include all the numbers?
	<alt>Look at line 3, is it iterating through the whole list?
User: No I do not. I'm iterating through the whole list of numbers.
	<alt>I don't know, how could I find out?
	<alt>Oh, I see, the return statement is in the wrong place.
Assistant: Let's verify this by tracing the code in the loop. Can you tell me what line 3 does?
	<alt>What can cause a function to end early?
	<alt>What forces a loop to end?
User: Line 3 starts the loop, and it iterates through everything in `nums`.
Assistant: Good, then what happens?
	<alt>Yes, you are right. Next, you have your if-statement. Is there anything in the if-statement that could make a loop end early?
	<alt>Think back to what you know about functions. What makes them end early?
	<alt>Think back to what you know about loops, what can make them stop?
User: The if statement starts on line 4, it checks if the number is even.
Assistant: Do you see anything on line 4 that could cause the function to return a list with one element instead of multiple elements?
	<alt>Do you notice anything on line 4 that causes the function to end early?
	<alt>Do you notice anything on line 4 that causes the for loop to end?
User: I don't see anything that can cause that problem.
	<alt>I see! The return statement after the if-statement is indented too much!
Assistant: Okay, so what happens next on line 6?
User: It returns the list.
	<alt>I get it! It's returning after every iteration!
	<alt>It's returning too soon.
Assistant: When should it return the list?
	<alt>Would a return statement end a loop?
	<alt>Would a return statement cause the function to terminate early?
	<alt>Is there anything on this line that would cause the loop or the function to end early?
	<alt>When does your return statement execute?
User: It should return the list when it finishes all the numbers.
Assistant: Look at line 6, what level of indentation is the list on?
	<alt>Think back to what you have learned about indentation, how does that control the order of actions in a loop?
	<alt>Can the return statement end the loop early?
User: I see, I'm indenting too much! It's returning the list as part of the loop, not after it. Let me change the indentation of the return statement.
<code>
1. def returnOdd(nums):
2.    newNums = []
3.    for i in nums:
4.        if i % 2 != 0:
5.            newNums.append(i)
6.    return newNums

</code>
Assistant: What does it return now, after you changed the indentation of the return statement?
User: It works properly! Thank you! Now the return statement executes after the for loop iterates through all the elements in `nums`.
Assistant: You're welcome. Let me know if I can be of any further assistance.
