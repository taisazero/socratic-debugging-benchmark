<problem>
The four compass points can be abbreviated by single-letter strings as “N”, “E”, “S”, and “W”. Write a function `turn_clockwise (compass_point:str)` that takes one of these four compass points as its parameter, and returns the next compass point in the clockwise direction. If `compass_point` has another value that's distinct from the four compass points listed earlier, return the value `None`.


## Example Cases:
```
turn_clockwise("N") => "E"
turn_clockwise("W") => "N"
turn_clockwise("S") => "W"
turn_clockwise("E") => "S"
turn_clockwise(42) => None
turn_clockwise("rubbish") => None
```
</problem>
<bug_code>
1. def turn_clockwise(compass_point):
2.    if compass_point == "N":
3.        print ("E")
4.    elif compass_point == "E":
5.        print ("S")
6.    elif compass_point == "S":
7.        print ("W")
8.    elif compass_point == "W":
9.        print ("N")
10.    else:
11.        print ("None")
</bug_code>
<bug_desc>
The function prints the strings "N", "E", "S", "W", and "None". Consequently, the function returns `None` for all cases of `compass_point` instead of returning the appropriate strings.
</bug_desc>
<bug_fixes>
Replace all the print statements `print ("E")`, `print ("S")`, `print ("W")`, `print ("N")`, `print("None")` with the return statements `return "E"`, `return "S"`, `return "W"`, `return "N"`, `return "None"` on lines 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 respectively.
</bug_fixes>
<unit_tests>
assert turn_clockwise("N") == "E"
assert turn_clockwise("W") == "N" 
assert turn_clockwise("S") == "W"
assert turn_clockwise("E") == "S"
assert turn_clockwise(42) == None
assert turn_clockwise("rubbish") == None

User: Hi! I have a problem. My code does not generate the right result and I cannot figure that out.
Assistant: Hi! Let's take a look at your code. Could you explain how your code works?
	<alt>Hi! What makes you think that your program is not working properly?
	<alt>Can you give me an example where your code does not return the correct result?
	<alt>I see. Let’s run your code with the function call `store = turn_clockwise("N")` then print `store` and observe the output in the terminal. What do you see?
	<alt>I see. Suppose we run your code with the function call `store = turn_clockwise("N")`. What do you think the value of `store` will be after execution?
User: Ok. My code gets the current `compass_point` and prints the next one.
Assistant: What do you see as your output in the terminal and what are you passing as `compass_point`?
	<alt>What makes the result incorrect? Can you give me an example including what you are passing in as `compass_point` and what you observe in the terminal?
User: When I pass in `"N"` as `compass_point`. I see `"E"` printed in the terminal. That's strange since my output is printed correctly, but my program does not pass any of the tests.
Assistant: What does a unit test need from a function to ensure that the function works properly?
	<alt>Ah. How did you determine whether your function is correct?
	<alt>I see. Suppose we run your code with the function call `store = turn_clockwise("N")`. What do you think the value of `store` will be after execution?
	<alt>Is printing the same as returning a value?
	<alt>Say you want to store the output of your function into a variable, what would you need to do?
	<alt>What do you think a function needs to pass along its output to say get stored in a variable?
User: It probably needs the value outputted by the function. My function outputs `"E"` in the terminal when I pass in `"N"` to it. The output is correct, so I am really confused.
	<alt>I don't understand the question. Can you tell me more about unit tests?
Assistant: Correct. So would you be able to store the value outputted by the function into say a variable?
	<alt>Suppose we run your code with the function call `store = turn_clockwise("N")`. What do you think the value of `store` will be after execution?
	<alt>Is printing the same as returning a value?
User: Hypothetically yes. I should be able to store it in a variable. I have not tried though.
Assistant: Suppose we run your code with the function call `store = turn_clockwise("N")`. What do you think the value of `store` will be after execution?
	<alt>Let’s run your code with the function call `store = turn_clockwise("N")` then print `store` and observe the output in the terminal. What do you see?
User: Ah I think, it would be `"E"` in `store`. 
Assistant: Let’s try it and then print `store`. What do you observe in your terminal?
User: Hmm... I see `None`. That’s really strange.

<code>
1. def turn_clockwise(compass_point):
2.    if compass_point == "N":
3.        print ("E")
4.    elif compass_point == "E":
5.        print ("S")
6.    elif compass_point == "S":
7.        print ("W")
8.    elif compass_point == "W":
9.        print ("N")
10.    else:
11.        print ("None")
12. store = turn_clockwise("N")
13. print(store)

</code>

Assistant: What do you think the function needs to have in order to give its output to the variable?
	<alt>Do you recall, which reserved word in Python is used to return the output for a function back to a variable?
User: Ah! I think it might be `return`. Let me try that.
<code>
def turn_clockwise(compass_point):
    if compass_point == "N":
        return "E"
    elif compass_point == "E":
        return "S"
    elif compass_point == "S":
        return "W"
    elif compass_point == "W":
        return "N"
    else:
        return None
		
</code>
	<alt>I’m not really sure.
Assistant: Very good.
	<alt>Very good. Is there a way for you to simplify your code?
User: Thank you so much!
Assistant: You’re welcome! Let me know if I can be of any further help.
