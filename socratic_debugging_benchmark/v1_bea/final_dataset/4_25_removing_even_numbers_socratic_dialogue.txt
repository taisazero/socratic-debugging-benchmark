<problem>
Create a method `returnOdd(nums:List[int]) -> List[int]` that accepts a list `nums`. It should filter out all the even integers from the list `nums` and return a new list that contains only the odd integers from the original list.

## Example Cases:
```
returnOdd([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]) => [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
returnOdd([2, 4, 6, 8, 10]) => []
returnOdd([1, 3, 5, 7, 9]) => [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
returnOdd([-76, -92, 9, -1, 7, 10]) => [9, -1, 7]
```
</problem>
<bug_code>
1. def returnOdd(nums):
2.    newNums = []
3.    for i in nums:
4.        if i % 2 != 0:
5.            newNums.append(i)
6. return newNums
</bug_code>
<bug_desc>
There is a syntax error on line 6. The return statement is not within a function scope.
</bug_desc>
<bug_fixes>
Insert a tab indentation before `return newNums` on line 6.

<unit_tests>
assert returnOdd([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]) == [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
assert returnOdd([2, 4, 6, 8, 10]) == []
assert returnOdd([1, 3, 5, 7, 9]) == [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
assert returnOdd([-76, -92, 9, -1, 7, 10]) == [9, -1, 7]

User: Hi! I implemented my method but it throws a syntax error that says my return statement is outside the function. Can you help me resolve this?
	<alt>Hi! I am working on the method to remove even numbers, but it is not running because of line 6. Can you help me find out what is wrong here?
Assistant: Sure, let's look at the error together. Do you know what the error "SyntaxError: 'return' outside function" means?
	<alt>I'm here to help! Let's think about what this error might mean. Do you know what might be causing it?
	<alt>Let's warm up by thinking about what the "scope" of a code block means. Do you know what that is and how that might affect a "return" statement?
User: Does it mean that my return statement is not currently a part of my function?
	<alt>The scope of the function means that the statements should be at the indentation level of the function, so all those statements are a part of the function.
Assistant: That's right, taking a look at your code, do you think your return statement is a part of your function?
	<alt>Could you tell me what we might need to do to make sure that the function returns the value we need it to?
	<alt>What might you need to do to make sure the return statement is in the scope of your function?
User: I see, so to make the return statement a part of the function correctly, I need to indent it to make sure it lies in the right scope.
	<alt>I think the indentation for the return statement to be inside the function it needs to be indented, to the level of line 2 not line 1.
