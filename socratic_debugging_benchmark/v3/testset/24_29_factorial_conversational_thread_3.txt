<problem>
Write a function `factorial(n:int) -> int` that computes the factorial n! of a natural number n, which is defined mathematically as:

$0! = 1$
$n! = n \times (n - 1)!$

Additionally, if the input integer n is negative the function should return 0.

## Example Cases:
```
factorial(-1) => 0
factorial(0) => 1
factorial(1) => 1
factorial(2) => 2
factorial(3) => 6
factorial(4) => 24
factorial(5) => 120
```
</problem>
<bug_code>
1. def factorial(n):
2.        if n < 0:
3.                return 0
4.        fact = 1
5.        for i in range(n):
6.                fact = fact * i
7.        return fact
</bug_code>
<bug_desc>
On line 6, `fact` is multiplied with 0 in the first iteration of the for loop. Consequently, at every iteration fact stays equal with 0 instead of being updated to be equal with factorial of `(i + 1)`. Therefore, the function will return 0, irrespective of n

</bug_desc>
<bug_fixes>
Replace `i` with `(i + 1)` in line 6.
Replace `range(n)` with `range(1, n + 1)` in line 5.

User: Hi! I implemented the factorial function but it doesn't work and I do not know why. Can you help?
Assistant: Sure. Can you tell me for what values of n it fails and what values it returns in those cases?
	<alt>Certainly. Can you tell me what happens when you run the function with `n = 2`?
	<alt>Can you describe your issue in more detail?
	<alt>Try running the function against the test cases. Do you observe any patterns?
User: For n = 1 or larger it returns the same value, 0.
Assistant: Let's see what happens when `n` is 1. What is the first value that is assigned to variable `i` in line 5?
	<alt>Let's see what happens when `n` is 1. Before line 6 is evaluated in the first iteration of the for loop, what are the values of the variables `fact` and `i`?
	<alt>Let's see what happens when `n` is 1. Can you insert a new line between lines 5 and 6 that prints the values of the variables `fact` and `i`?
	<alt>Let's see what happens when `n` is 1. What does `range(n)` do when `n` is 1?
	<alt>Can you tell me what `range(n)` does?
	<alt>Let's start with a warm-up question, does `range(n)` start with 0 or 1?
	<alt>According to the Python documentation, does `range(n)` start with 0 or 1?
User: The first value assigned to `i` will be 1.
	<alt>Aaah, I understand! The first value assigned to `i` will be 0, because `range` by default starts at 0.
	<alt>Oh! `i` is not declared before the for loop is created maybe that causes this issue.
Assistant: Are you sure about that? Can you verify that the first value assigned to `i` is 1?
	<alt>How can you verify that the first value assigned to `i` is 1?
	<alt>Let's verify this. Open the Python shell and type `[i for i in range(1)]`. What do you see? 
	<alt>Let's verify this. Add a print statement inside the for loop that prints the value of `i` at each iteration. What is the first value of `i`?
	<alt>Can you look in the Python documentation to see what is the first value computed by range, when used with only one argument?
	<alt>Let's open the debugger. Step through your code until you reach line 6 for the first time. What do you notice about the value of `i`?
	<alt>Can you explain how `i` would be equal to 1 during the first iteration of the for loop?
	<alt>Let's assume that `i` is equal to 1 during the first iteration of the for loop. Given that `fact` is assigned the value 1 on line 4, how do you explain the function returning 0 when `n` is 1?
User: OK, let me print its value at each iteration. I see, the first value is 0, not 1!
<code>
1. def factorial(n):
2.        if n < 0:
3.                return 0
4.        fact = 1
5.        for i in range(n):
6.                print(i)
7.                fact = fact * i
8.        return fact
</code>
Assistant: What happens when any number is multiplied by 0?
	<alt>That's right. What happens when `fact` is multiplied by `i`?
	<alt>Given that `i` is 0 in the first iteration of the for loop, what is the value of `fact` after the product operation is executed?
	<alt>Now, how do you explain the function returning 0 when `n` is greater or equal to 1?
User: It becomes 0. I see now. `fact` becomes 0 after the product operation is executed. That's why my function returns 0 for all `n >= 1`.
Assistant: How can you modify your code to fix this issue?
	<alt>How can you fix the code so that in the first iteration `fact` is multiplied with 1, not with 0?
User: I don't know, can you help?
	<alt>I will multiply fact with `i + 1`. Let me do that â€¦ It works! Thank you for your help!
	<alt>I can change to `range(1,  n + 1)` so that it starts iterating at 1.
	<alt>I can change to `range(1, n)` so that it starts iterating at 1.
	<alt>I can change to `range(n) + 1`, so that the first value is 0 + 1.
Assistant: How can you ensure that in the first iteration `fact` is multiplied by 1?
	<alt>Think about what `range(n)` does to `i`. How can you ensure that in the first iteration `fact` is never multiplied by 0?
	<alt>How can you change the for loop so that the iterator variable `i` is not equal to 0 in the first iteration of the for loop?
	<alt>Let's take it one step at a time. The cause of the issue is that `fact` is multiplied by 0 in the first iteration of the for loop. To fix this issue, what do we need to prevent?
	<alt>How can you change the for loop so that the iterator variable `i` iterates starting from 1?
User: I can add a line that sets `i` to 1 before the for loop.
<code>
1. def factorial(n):
2.        if n < 0:
3.                return 0
4.        fact = 1
5.        i = 1
6.        for i in range(n):
7.                print(i)
8.                fact = fact * i
9.        return fact
</code>
Assistant: Let's see if that works. Can you try it for `n = 1`?
	<alt>Ok! Let's run the code for `n = 2` and see what happens.
	<alt>How can you verify that the first value assigned to `i` is 1?
User: Hm... It still returns 0. I rushed.
	<alt>It still returns 0. I rushed. I think I need to change the for loop.
Assistant: Do you know why it still returns 0?
	<alt>What do you think `range(n)` is doing to `i`?
	<alt>Let's look at the terminal output. What value is `i` when being printed on line 7?
User: I think the problem is that `i` is still 0 in the first iteration of the for loop. It still prints 0. I think I can add an `if` statement to the for loop that checks if `i` is 0 and if so, sets it to 1.
<code>
1. def factorial(n):
2.        if n < 0:
3.                return 0
4.        fact = 1
5.        i = 1
6.        for i in range(n):
7.                if i == 0:
8.                    i = 1
9.                  print(i)
10.                fact = fact * i
11.        return fact
</code>
	<alt>It still prints 0. I think I need to make a change in the for loop.
	<alt>I don't know. Can you help?
Assistant: Let's see if that works. Can you try it against the test cases?
	<alt>Ok! Let's run the code for `n>=2` and see what happens.
	<alt>Is there a simpler way to fix this issue?
	<alt>What happens to `i` in the second iteration of the for loop now?
User: Hm... it's incorrect for both `n = 2` and `n = 3`. I think I need to multiply `fact` starting from 1, then 2, then 3 instead of what I'm doing now 1, then 1, then 2.
Assistant: Good. How can you change the for loop so that the iterator variable `i` is not equal to 0 in the first iteration of the for loop?
	<alt>How can you edit the code so that `fact` is multiplied with 1, then 2, then 3?
	<alt>What do you think you can do to make sure that `fact` is multiplied with 1, then 2, then 3?
	<alt>How can you change the for loop so that the iterator variable `i` iterates starting from 1?
User: I think I am going to change `range` to `range(1, n + 1)` so that it starts iterating at 1.
<code>
1. def factorial(n):
2.        if n < 0:
3.                return 0
4.        fact = 1
5.        i = 1
6.        for i in range(1, n + 1):
7.                print(i)
8.                fact = fact * i
9.        return fact

</code>
	<alt>I think I am going to change `range` to `range(1, n)` so that it starts iterating at 1.
	<alt>I think I am going to change `range` to `range(n) + 1` so that the first value is 0 + 1.
Assistant: Sounds good. Let's try it on all the test cases especially for `n = 2` and `n = 3` again.
	<alt>Did you try it again for `n >=2`?
User: It works! Thank you for your help!
Assistant: Awesome. Don't forget to remove the print statement before you submit your code.
	<alt>Good! I'm glad I could help. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask me again.
User: Thank you! I will do that.
