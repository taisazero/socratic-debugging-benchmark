<problem>
Define a function called `Product(a:int, b:int) -> int` which takes two integer inputs: a and b. The function should return the product of these two values (i.e. a * b).

## Example Cases: 
```
Product(1,2) => 2
Product(2,4) => 8
Product(4,4) => 16
Product(5,5) => 25
```
</problem>
<bug_code>
1. def Product(a, b):
2.	a * b
</bug_code>
<bug_desc>
The function does not return anything, thus when evaluated it computes the value `None` instead of returning the product.
</bug_desc>
<bug_fixes>
Add `return` before `a * b`.
</bug_fixes>
<unit_tests>
assert Product(1,2) == 2
assert Product(2,4) == 8
assert Product(4,4) == 16
assert Product(5,5) == 25
</unit_tests>

User: Hello, I'm having trouble with `Product()` function. I swear that I have done it correctly, but I'm failing even the first assertion and I can't figure out why.
Assistant: Okay, can you explain your `Product()` function in detail?
	<alt>Could you tell me what functions are and how are they used in Python?
	<alt>Upon running your code against the test cases, do you observe any errors?
	<alt>Can you describe what happens after the function finishes multiplying `a` and `b`?
	<alt>Suppose we run `store = Product(1,2)`, what do you think the value of `store` will be after execution?
	<alt>Let's run `store = Product(1,2)` and then print `store` and observe the output in the terminal. What do you see?
User: I take in two inputs, which I have named `a` and `b`, and then I multiply the two numbers together.
Assistant: Okay, can you modify your code such that on line 3, you execute the line `print(Product(1,2))`?
	<alt>How can we output the value of `Product(1,2)` to the user through the console?

User: Oh! I made the change and now it prints out `None`.  I realized I just forgot to put a `return` statement and I've now fixed it. Thanks for the help!
<code>
1. def Product(a, b):
2.        a * b
3. print(Product(1,2))
</code>
Assistant: You're welcome! Any other ways I can help you today?
	<alt>How did you verify that your implementation is correct?
User: No, that's all for now. Thanks! I think my implementation is correct because it passes all the test cases.
