<problem>
Write a function `search(x: int, seq: List[int]) -> int` that returns the index of the first occurrence of `x` in `seq`. If `x` is not in `seq`, return the index where `x` should be inserted to keep `seq` sorted. Assume that `seq` is sorted in ascending order.
## Example Cases:
```
search(5, [-1, 5, 8, 10, 12]) => 1
search(-2, [-1, 57, 65]) => 0
search(0, [-120, 60, 78, 100]) => 1
search(77, [-100, -50, 5, 44, 66, 76, 99]) => 6
search(55, [-99, -2, 0]) => 3
```
</problem>
<bug_code>
1. def search(x, seq):
2.  for i in range(len(seq)):
3.    if x < seq[i]:
4.      return i
5.  return len(seq)
</bug_code>
<bug_desc>
On line 3, the function only checks if `x` is less than `seq[i]` and then returns the index `i` where `x` should be inserted. When `x` is in `seq` at position `i`, the function returns the next index `i + 1` instead of the current index `i`.

Replace `<` with `<=` on line 3

User: Hi! My code passes all tests but the first one, and I cannot figure out what's wrong. Can you help?
Assistant: Sure. In the first test case, the input `x` is an element in the list `seq`. According to the problem description, what needs to be returned when `x` is an element of `seq`?
	<alt>Sure. Can you tell me if you notice any difference between the first test case and the other test cases?
	<alt>Sure. In the first test case, can you explain why the correct return value should be 1?
	<alt>Sure. Let's consider the first test case, when the input `x` is 5 and the list `seq` has the value `[-1, 5, 8, 10, 12]`. When `i` takes the value 1 in line 2, what is the value of `seq[i],` and what happens when we run through the if on line 3?
User: We should return the index of `x` in `seq`.
Assistant: Good. Now, looking at your code, does it ever return an index `i` such that the element at that index is equal to `x`?
	<alt>Good. How do you find the index of `x` in a list `seq`?
	<alt>Good. If the current index is `i`, how do you determine if the element at position `i` in the list `seq` is equal to `x`?
User: Oh, it always returns a position where `seq[i] > x`. I think I need to also test for equality, let me do that... It works now, thank you!
<code>
1. def search(x, seq):
2.  for i in range(len(seq)):
3.    if x <= seq[i]:
4.      return i
5.  return len(seq)
