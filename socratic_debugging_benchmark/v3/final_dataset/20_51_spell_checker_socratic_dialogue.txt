<problem>
Write a function `spellchecker(words: List[str], words_to_check: List[str]) -> Iterable[str]` that takes in a list of words and a list of words to check. The function should return an iterable of strings that indicate whether or not each word in `words_to_check` are spelled properly. A word is spelled properly if it is in the `words` list. If a word is spelled properly, the string should say "[word] is spelled properly!". If a word is misspelled, the string should say "[word] is misspelled!". The order of the strings in the returned list should be the same as the order of the words in `words_to_check`.
## Example Cases:
```
list(spellchecker(["dog", "cat", "giraffe", "horse", "dragon"], ["dogz", "cet", "giraffe", "horsee", "dragon"])) => ["dogz is misspelled!", "cet is misspelled!", "giraffe is spelled properly!", "horsee is misspelled!", "dragon is spelled properly!"]
list(spellchecker(["apple", "banana", "orange", "pear", "grape"], ["apple", "baana", "orange", "pier", "grayp"])) => ["apple is spelled properly!", "baana is misspelled!", "orange is spelled properly!", "pier is misspelled!", "grayp is misspelled!"]
list(spellchecker(['bubbles', 'cup', 'food'], ['bubbles', 'cup', 'food', 'bubbles', 'cup', 'food'])) => ['bubbles is spelled properly!', 'cup is spelled properly!', 'food is spelled properly!', 'bubbles is spelled properly!', 'cup is spelled properly!', 'food is spelled properly!']
list(spellchecker([], ['bubbles', 'cup', 'food'])) => ['bubbles is misspelled!', 'cup is misspelled!', 'food is misspelled!']
```
</problem>
<bug_code>
1. def spellchecker(words, words_to_check):
2.    result = []
3.    for word in words_to_check:
4.        if word in words:
5.            result.append(word + " is spelled properly!")
6.        else:
7.            result.append(word + " is misspelled!")
</bug_code>
<bug_desc>
The function returns `None` instead of an iterable of strings.
</bug_desc>
<bug_fixes>
After line 7, insert `return result` with one indentation level.

User: Help! I'm really stuck.
Assistant: Okay, where do you think the problem is?
	<alt>Are any of the test cases passing?
	<alt>Have you completed all the steps in the instructions?
	<alt>Let's look at your function, can you explain what it is supposed to do?
	<alt>Upon running your code against the test cases, do you observe any errors?
	<alt>What is the purpose of the `result` variable in your function?
	<alt>Can you describe what happens after the function finishes checking all the words in `words_to_check`?
	<alt>Suppose we run `store = spellchecker(["dog", "cat", "giraffe", "horse", "dragon"], ["dogz", "cet", "giraffe", "horsee", "dragon"])`, what do you think the value of `store` will be after execution.
	<alt>Let's run `store = spellchecker(["dog", "cat", "giraffe", "horse", "dragon"], ["dogz", "cet", "giraffe", "horsee", "dragon"])` and then print `store` and observe the output in the terminal. What do you see?
User: I don't know.
Assistant: Can you explain what your function is supposed to do?

User: My function takes in one list of words and compares it to another list.
	<alt>My function compares two lists of words and then returns information about them.
	<alt>I followed the prompt.
Assistant: Is that everything it is supposed to do according to the prompt?
	<alt>Does it do anything else? 
	<alt>Can you describe specifically what happens after the function finishes checking all the words in `words_to_check`?
	<alt>Can you explain specifically what the purpose of the `result` variable is in your function?
User: I think so.
Assistant: Upon running your code, what output do you observe in the terminal?
	<alt>How would that information be sent out of the function?
	<alt>What information is supposed to be returned from the function?
	<alt>Can you describe specifically what happens after the function finishes checking all the words in `words_to_check`?
	<alt>Can you explain specifically what the purpose of the `result` variable is in your function?
User: It says there is a TypeError and that NoneType objects aren't iterable.
Assistant: Okay, so let's break that down. Let's focus on the NoneType part, what is a NoneType?
	<alt>What could cause your function to return a NoneType object?
	<alt>Let's run `store = spellchecker(["dog", "cat", "giraffe", "horse", "dragon"], ["dogz", "cet", "giraffe", "horsee", "dragon"])` and then print `store` and observe the output in the terminal. What do you see?
	<alt>What can we conclude about the `spellchecker` function output?
	<alt>Check the Python documentation, why do functions return NoneType objects?
User: A that's an object that doesn't have a value.
	<alt>I'm not sure.
Assistant: What could cause your function to return a NoneType object?
	<alt>What can we conclude about the `spellchecker` function output?
	<alt>Check the Python documentation, why do functions return NoneType objects?
	<alt>What do you expect your function to return instead?
User: I don't know.
        <alt>My function doesn't return anything!
Assistant: What do you expect your function to return instead?
	<alt>Check the Python documentation, why do functions return NoneType objects?
	<alt>What happens when a function never returns?
User: I forgot the return statement!
<code>
1. def spellchecker(words, words_to_check):
2.    result = []
3.    for word in words_to_check:
4.        if word in words:
5.            result.append(word + " is spelled properly!")
6.        else:
7.            result.append(word + " is misspelled!")
8.    return result

Assistant: Good. Does it pass all the unit tests now?
User: Yes it does! Thank you!
